# Terraform-Champs
Terraform Champs initiation offers practical Terraform tasks and a guide for beginners.
At the start I will provide an AWS account for each champion, along with a list of daily tasks spanning four days.

# Day one task
use IaC Terrafrom to build the following resource besides requirement specifications:

- Create VPC.
- Create Public subnet.
- Create internet gateway attached to the subent.
- Create route table to route all trrafic to the internet gateway.

  ## Requirement Specifications:
  - Resources must be created at us-east-1 region otherwise will fail.
  - Resources must have tags as below otherwise will fail <br>
    Key: "Environment"   Value: "terraformChamps" <br>
    Key: "Owner"   Value: "<type_your_name_here>" <br>

  - Preferd to use variables.
  ## Code Sample:
- [Day One sample](https://github.com/Mohamed-Eleraki/Terraform-Champs/tree/main/dayOneSample)
<br>
<br>



# Day Two task
use IaC Terrafrom to build the following resource besides requirement specifications:

- Use S3 to store Terraform statefile using "erakiterrafromstatefiles" bucket
- Create S3 Bucket.
- Enable S3 Bucker Versioning.
- Disable ACL and ensure object ownership have "BucketOwnerEnforced"
- Create a directory under the S3 Bucket called "logs"
- Provide Bucket policy permission for your IAM user to upload object only under logs.
- Force destroy Bucket even if the bucket is not empty.

  ## Requirement Specifications:
  - Resources must be created at us-east-1 region otherwise will fail.
  - Resources must have tags as below otherwise will fail <br>
    Key: "Environment"   Value: "terraformChamps" <br>
    Key: "Owner"   Value: "<type_your_name_here>" <br>

  - Preferd to use variables.

<br>
<br>



# Day Three task
use IaC Terrafrom to build the following resource besides requirement specifications:
- Use S3 to store Terraform statefile using "erakiterrafromstatefiles" bucket
    - Consider to use difrrent name that others _(i.e. specify a unique name for state file key)_
- Create an S3 Bucket
- Create Directories as (e.g. /log, /outgoing, /incomming)
<br><br>
*Today's Example will Create an Amazon S3 storage and configure the S3 Lifecycle rules as as the following:*

- Transition all files under /log to infrequent access (i.e. Standard-IA) 30 consecutive days after creation time.

- Transition all files under /log to Archive access (i.e. Glacier) 90 consecutive days after creation time.

- Transition all files under /log to Deep Archive access (i.e. Glacier Deep Archive) 180 consecutive days after creation time.

- Remove all files under /log 365 consecutive days after creation time.

- Transition all files under /outgoing with tag "notDeepArchive" to infrequent access (i.e. Standard-IA) 30 consecutive days after creation time.

- Transition all files under /outgoing to Archive access (i.e. Glacier) with tag "notDeepArchive" 90 consecutive days after creation time.

- Transition all files under /incoming with size between 1MB to 1G to infrequent access (i.e. Standard-IA) 30 consecutive days after creation time.

- Transition all files under /incoming with size between 1MB to 1G to Archive access (i.e. Glacier) 90 consecutive days after creation time.


  ## Requirement Specifications:

  - Resources must have tags as below otherwise will fail <br>

  # Day Four task
use IaC Terrafrom to build the following resource besides requirement specifications:<br>

- Use S3 to store Terraform statefile using "erakiterrafromstatefiles" bucket
    - Consider to use difrrent name that others _(i.e. specify a unique name for state file key)_
- Create IAM user named Ahmed *
    - With EC2 Administrator Policy _"AWS Managed policy"_
- Create IAM user named Mahmoud 
    - With S3 put and get objects restricted with specific source IP 
- Create IAM user named Mostafa 
    - With IAM Role have access to get objects from S3.
